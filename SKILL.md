description: Use when researching what a single company did over the last ~90 days to find outbound/ABM angles — product launches, hiring, funding, leadership changes, expansion, or risk signals — for an SDR or AE preparing cold outreach or account research ("why now", trigger events, buying signals, "what happened at X recently", "prep me for a call with").

# Last Quarter

## Overview

Given ONE company domain, produce a **neutral, cited signal report** of what the company
*did* over the trailing ~90 days, so a seller can pick their own "why now" angle.

**Core principle:** **every claim carries an inline source URL + date, or it doesn't
ship.** A rep pastes these into emails — a hallucinated or stale signal gets them
burned. Trust is the product.

**Go to structured primary sources, not scrapers or aggregators.** The failure mode
this skill exists to prevent: an agent scrapes a JS careers page, gives up, and reports
a fuzzy "~30 roles" from an aggregator — when the ATS JSON API returns 13 exact roles
with departments and post dates, for free. Always prefer the API.

## When to Use

- "What's happening at {company} lately / this quarter?" for outbound or account prep
- Building a "why now" / trigger-event angle before a cold email or call
- Single company only. (No list/batch mode — this is for the individual SDR/AE.)

## How to Run (engine first)

**Default path — run the engine.** A stdlib-only Python engine (no `pip install`) fans
out every source concurrently and returns structured JSON in ~7 seconds. Run it from the
directory containing this SKILL.md:

```bash
python3 engine/last_quarter.py {domain} --name "{Company}" --today {YYYY-MM-DD} --json
```

- `--today` = today's date (so the window is deterministic). Omit to use the system date.
- `--keywords "fintech OR banking"` — **required for common-word names** (Increase, Ramp,
  Notion…) or news is unfilterable noise. The engine flags `noisy: true` when it applies.
- Drop `--json` for a human-readable `compact` summary while debugging.

The JSON also has a top-level **`signals[]`** — every source's output flattened into one
uniform, sorted array of `{type, category, claim, date, url, source, confidence}`. This is
the **machine interface**: downstream tools/AI (copy skills, enrichment pipelines) should
consume `signals[]`, not re-parse the prose. `confidence` is `primary` (company-owned/
official), `unverified` (3rd-party news/HN — entity-check first), or `low` (noisy
common-word news). Build the human report from the per-source detail; hand `signals[]` to
machines.

The JSON also has `window`, `profile` (public/private routing), `sources_active`, and per
source (`careers`, `news`, `blog`, `status`, `hackernews`, `edgar`, `github`) the dated
signals + a `status` and `note`. (`status` = incidents/outages → Risk; `hackernews` =
Show-HN launches, competitor mentions, eng posts.) Careers also carries `senior_roles`,
`geo_note`, `tech_by_category`, `priorities`, `initiatives`; blog carries `customer_wins`;
github carries `new_repos`. **Synthesize the report (Output Contract below) from that JSON** — one pass, no
re-fetching. Respect each source's `note` (survivorship-bias caveat, noisy-news warning,
SDK-cadence note) and the `sources_active` count for the coverage line.

**Manual fallback.** If `python3` is unavailable, or a source comes back `empty`/`error`
and you want to dig further (e.g. a feedless blog whose `/blog` HTML needs a direct
`WebFetch`, or paid Firecrawl/Exa depth), use the source recipes below — they are the
exact spec the engine implements.

## The Pipeline (what the engine implements)

Run these steps in order. Steps 2–5 can run in parallel once routing is known.

### 1. Profile & route (do this first)

Derive the window from today's date: **trailing 90 days** (state the exact `YYYY-MM-DD
→ YYYY-MM-DD` window in the report header).

Classify the company so you don't waste calls or surface noise:

| Check | How | Switches ON |
|---|---|---|
| **Public?** | Look up name in `sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json`. Hit = public. | EDGAR filings + earnings news |
| **Private?** | Miss in ticker file | **Skip EDGAR.** Careers + news + blog carry it. |
| **Dev-tool?** | Has a public GitHub org / technical product | GitHub releases |

**Careers + Google News RSS are always-on**, regardless of profile.

### 2. Careers (the richest free signal — start here)

Resolve the ATS from the domain's brand token (`airops.com` → `airops`). Try Ashby,
Greenhouse, Lever; **accept the first that returns a NON-EMPTY jobs array** (a `200`
with `[]` or a tiny body is a dead board — Lever does this). Endpoints, fields, and the
date-field names for trajectory are in **references/sources.md**.

Report: listed role count, **how many posted in-window** (bucket by post date),
department concentration of recent reqs, and standout senior/leadership roles. No ATS
hit → the company uses a custom/Workday ATS: fall back to Google News + a `WebFetch` of
the `/careers` page (Firecrawl if it's an empty JS shell).

### 3. News (always-on)

**Google News RSS** first: `news.google.com/rss/search?q="{Company}" when:90d`. Parse
`<item>` title/link/pubDate. GDELT is a throttled backup (1 req / 5s). **Entity-check
every hit** — generic company names collide; confirm the article is about *this* company
before including it. **The `noisy` flag ≠ entity-clean:** `noisy:false` only means the
common-word *filter* didn't fire — YOU must still read each headline and drop same-name
collisions (a metal band, a different company sharing the name, a "Show HN" of an unrelated
tool). Do this even when `noisy` is false.

**Expect thin news for private / non-newsy vertical SaaS** — RSS + GDELT often return
almost nothing. When both are empty, **run one WebSearch pass** for
`{company} funding OR layoffs OR "new VP" OR acquisition` to affirmatively check for
funding, leadership, and negative events. Empty feeds mean "look harder," not "nothing
happened" — never infer absence of a signal from two empty feeds. See
references/sources.md.

### 4. Blog & changelog (free for most)

**Autodiscover the feed:** `WebFetch` the `/blog` and `/changelog` pages and read the
`<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">` tag; else try common feed paths.
Parse dated items, keep in-window ones. No feed? Plain `WebFetch` the index page —
titles/links are usually in the server-rendered HTML. Firecrawl only when the page is a
truly empty JS shell.

### 5. Public-company path (only if routed public)

`ticker/name → CIK → filings`. **8-K** = material events (exec changes, M&A, results);
**10-Q** = quarterly priorities + risk factors, straight from the company. Endpoints +
required `User-Agent` header in references/sources.md.

### 6. Synthesize into the report

Rank signals by **impact × recency** (a week-1 launch is stale by now; last week's is a
live trigger). Keep in-window and pre-window signals clearly separated — pre-window items
are context, not "why now".

**Don't claim hiring growth deltas.** ATS APIs return only *currently open* roles, so
filled/closed roles vanish — you cannot honestly say "16 posted this-90 vs 2 prior".
Frame careers as **composition + freshness**: "X of N open roles posted in-window,
concentrated in {departments}", plus standout senior reqs.

## Output Contract

Emit markdown in this shape (a positive recipe — fill every slot):

```
# Last Quarter — {Company}  ·  {YYYY-MM-DD → YYYY-MM-DD}
**Profile:** public/private · {industry} · sources active: {list} ({N of M})

## Top signals — ranked by impact × recency
1. **{signal}** — {one line}.  ({source} · {date}) {url}
2. …

## By category
- **Hiring:** {listed N; X posted in-window; dept concentration}. {ats url}
  - **Senior/leadership roles** (`senior_roles`) — VP/Head-of/Director/Founding/Chief reqs,
    named individually with date + job URL. A new senior req = a new budget owner. Leadership.
  - **Geo / expansion** (`geo_note`) — "N of M in-window roles are {EMEA/APAC/LATAM}-based
    → possible {region} expansion." Expansion signal.
  - **Tech stack** (mined from JD text, skill-context anchored) — grouped by category,
    ranked by # of JDs; each tool cites an example job. Signals what they run / build.
  - **Stated priorities** — "you'll lead our EU expansion"-type sentences, with the job.
  - **New initiatives** — "newly formed X team", "0-to-1", "standing up a new Y function"
    (a new team/function = new budget + a fresh buyer; the strongest JD trigger), with job.
- **Traction:** **customer wins** (`blog.customer_wins`) — new logos named in case-study
  post titles (Angi, Kayak…), each cited to the post. New reference customer = momentum.
- **Product direction:** **net-new GitHub repos** (`github.new_repos`) — repos *created*
  in-window (not forks) = a new product/SDK bet, distinct from release cadence.
- **Product launches:** … · **Leadership:** … · **Funding/M&A:** …
- **Expansion:** … · **Risk / negative:** incidents from `status.signals` (outages,
  degradations) + negative news {or "none surfaced this window"}.
- **Discussion / community:** `hackernews.signals` — Show-HN launches, competitor mentions,
  and the company's own engineering/AI posts. Slot HN items by what they are (launch → launches,
  competitor → risk, eng post → product direction).
- **Competitive:** `signals[]` records with `category: "competitive"` — displacement wins
  (they took a rival's customers), competitor attacks (someone launched a rival at them),
  comparisons (bracketed vs a named rival); the competitor is named. **Dual-use:** point the
  skill at a *competitor's* domain and every signal reads as competitor tracking — this
  category makes that explicit.

## Coverage & confidence
Sources active: {N of M}. Add a {Firecrawl/Exa/PredictLeads} key to unlock {what}.
Primary-sourced vs aggregator-sourced claims are labeled; unverified items flagged.

{engine `footer` field — passed through verbatim; 7 sources, "N/M applicable" (— = not
applicable / routed off, excluded from the denominator), e.g.:}
---
✅ sources reported back — 4/6 applicable
└─ careers ✓ 74 · news ✓ 47 · blog ✗ · status ✓ 18 · hackernews ✓ 6 · edgar — · github ✗
---
```

**Rules that make it trustworthy:**
- **Inline source + date on every claim.** Never a lump of sources at the end.
- **Cite news as "{Title} — {outlet} · {date}".** Lead with the outlet (from the signal's
  `source`/`outlet`), not the raw link — Google News URLs are opaque `news.google.com/...`
  redirects that resolve in-browser but can't be eyeballed. Outlet + clean title + date is
  the trustworthy citation; the link is just the click target.
- **Primary sources beat aggregators.** ATS, EDGAR, company blog, press releases first.
  A funding or headcount number from Crunchbase/Sacra/Tracxn/Built In alone is
  **labeled "aggregator, unverified"** — never stated as fact.
- **Negative signals are in scope.** Layoffs, outages, incidents, exec departures, suits
  — surface them. The report is neutral, not a highlight reel.
- **End with the engine's `footer` verbatim.** The coverage line is the trust device —
  it states exactly what was pulled and what was empty. Never omit or paraphrase it.

## Graceful Degradation

Free tier (no keys) must stand alone: careers APIs + Google News RSS + EDGAR + feeds
already produce a real report (verified: even a thin Series-A returns ~13 roles, a
launch, and a positioning shift). Keys deepen, they aren't required. Always end with
"sources active: N of M" and what a key would add — **never return an empty report.**

Paid upgrades (self-serve keys only — activate automatically when the env var is set):
- **`EXA_API_KEY` → `exa` source (BUILT):** entity-resolved, date-filtered news with real
  publisher URLs — fixes common-word name collisions (Reflow≠Reflow Medical) and the opaque
  Google-News-URL problem. Distinctive names are clean out-of-box; for common-word names it
  drops same-name companies' own domains, sets `noisy:true`, and recommends `--keywords
  "<what they do>"` (which cleans it fully). Prefer `exa` signals over free `news` when both
  are present.
- **`FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` → blog escalation (BUILT):** renders JS-shell blog listings the
  free tier can't read. **Escalation-only** (fires only when the free blog is a true JS
  shell) and **listing-only, never per-post** (≤2 credits/company). Recovers post
  titles/URLs → customer-wins + competitive + topics; **dates unavailable** from a rendered
  listing (labeled as such — not for launch recency).
- Planned: **Apify** (LinkedIn/Twitter/Trustpilot).

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake (all seen in unaided baseline) | Fix |
|---|---|
| Scraping the JS careers page, then using an aggregator's job count | Hit the ATS JSON API → exact roles, departments, dates |
| Reporting a fuzzy "~30 roles" | Count from `.jobs[]`; give listed count + in-window posts |
| Stating a funding figure from an aggregator | Require a primary source, else mark unverified |
| Flat snapshot, no trend | Bucket dated items this-90 vs prior-90 |
| Running EDGAR on a private company | Profile first; EDGAR only when a CIK exists |
| Sources lumped at the end | Inline source + date per claim |
| "Insufficient signal" empty report | Free tier still returns ATS + Google News; state what a key adds |
| Accepting a `200` from an ATS as a valid board | Require a non-empty jobs array |
| Including same-name news | Entity-check each article against the target company |
| Reporting careers "this-90 vs prior-90" as growth | ATS shows only open roles (survivorship bias); frame as composition + freshness |
| Inferring "no news" from empty RSS/GDELT | Run a WebSearch pass for funding/leadership/negative before concluding absence |
